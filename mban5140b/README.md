## Part 1: GMM Model Update 
- **Task 1**: Update the GMM model from class to include a non-zero bias term (𝛿) in the instrumental-variable moment expression.
- **Task 2**: Analyze the GMM summary table and test statistics to determine if the industry expert’s claim about bias is statistically justified.

## Part 2: Credit Approval Process 
- **Task 1**: Use “midterm_parttwo.csv” to fit a logistic regression model predicting credit ratings from customer features. Split the data into training (50%) and test (50%) sets. Report confusion matrix, recall, precision, and F1 score.
- **Task 2**: Adjust the model for a stricter approval process (15% approval rate). Calculate the new threshold and update the confusion matrix, recall, precision, and F1 scores.
